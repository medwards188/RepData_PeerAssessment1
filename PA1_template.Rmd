## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
dailysteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activity, FUN=sum)
barplot(dailysteps$steps, names.arg=dailysteps$date, xlab="date", ylab="steps")
```

2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
mean(dailysteps$steps)
median(dailysteps$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
